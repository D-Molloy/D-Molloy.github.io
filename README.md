# Basic-Portfolio
Assignment #1 - Coding Boot Camp @ UNC Chapel Hill

This repository contains a simple 3-page portfolio site written in HTML and CSS.
The three pages are:
1 - index.html: The landing page for the portfolio site introducing you to Denis
2 - portfolio.html: A portfolio page that includes a gallery of mock projects (COMING SOON!)
3 - contact.html: A page with a (placeholder) form to get in touch with Denis.
